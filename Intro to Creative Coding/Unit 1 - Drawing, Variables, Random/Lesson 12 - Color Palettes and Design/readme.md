# Color Palettes and Design
What are our best practices for working with code?

## Overview

In this learning activity students add color to the drawing they made in activity 1. They learn to apply the background, fill, and stroke functions (used in scales of gray until now), to define colors and add transparency. Both the RGB (Red, green, blue) and HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color models are applied.

Students apply the programming concepts they learned in the previous unit (variables, randomness) to color manipulation, defining color ranges and palettes.

## Suggested Duration

45 minutes

## Objectives

### Students will be able to:

- Understand how to pick a color palette and use color wisely.

## Student Outcomes

### Abstraction:

- Describe how I might use patterns to express an idea.
- Explain why using patterns is necessary when creating with a computer.

## Vocabulary

- **Color Palette**	In the digital world, refers to the full range of colors that can be displayed on a device screen or other interface.
- **Primary Color**	Any of a group of colors from which all other colors can be obtained by mixing.
- **Secondary Color**	a color resulting from the mixing of two primary colors.
- **Accent Colors**	Colors that are used for emphasis in a color scheme.
- **Complementary Colors**	Colors directly opposite each other in the color spectrum, such as red and green or blue and orange, that when combined in the right proportions, produce white light.
- **Analogous Colors**	Groups of three colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, sharing a common color, with one being the dominant color, which tends to be a primary or secondary color, and a tertiary. Red, orange, and red-orange are examples.
