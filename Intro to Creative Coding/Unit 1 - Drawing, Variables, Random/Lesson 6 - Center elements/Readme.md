# Center elements with built-in variables: width and height
How can I create custom variables to hold values in my p5.js projects?

## Overview

In this learning activity, students create their own variables to set the position, size and grey scale color of their shapes without repeating code.

## Suggested Duration

45 minutes

## Objectives

Students will be able to:

- Identify repeated values in their code and use variables in their place.
- Create and implement custom variables
