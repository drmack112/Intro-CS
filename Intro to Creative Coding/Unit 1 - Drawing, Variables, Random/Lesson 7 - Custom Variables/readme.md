# Custom Variables
How can I create custom variables to hold values in my p5.js projects?

## Overview

In this learning activity, students create their own variables to set the position, size and grey scale color of their shapes without repeating code.

## Suggested Duration

90 minutes

## Objectives

### Students will be able to:

- Identify repeated values in their code and use variables in their place.
- Create and implement custom variables

## Student Outcomes

### Abstraction:

- Describe how I might use patterns to express an idea.
- Describe different things I tried in order to achieve a goal.
- Explain why using patterns is necessary when creating with a computer.

### Algorithms:

- Describe more than one set of instructions that might complete a task.
- Describe how instructions can have different outputs depending on inputs.
- Explain why I used specific instructions to complete a task.
- Compare and contrast my instructions with other instructions that complete the same task.

### Programming:

- Experiment with the commands of a programming language.
- Explain why I chose specific commands to communicate my instructions.
- Discuss what can and cannot be done with a specific set of commands.

## Vocabulary

- **Scope**	Where a variable can be ‘seen’ by the computer within a program.
- **Global Variables**	Variables declared outside of a function which can be used in any function.
- **Local (script) Variables**	Variables declared within a function whose scope is limited to that function.
- **var**	Declaration of variable words in p5.js.
