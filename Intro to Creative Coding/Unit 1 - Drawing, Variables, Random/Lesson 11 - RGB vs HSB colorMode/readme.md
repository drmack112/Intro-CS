# RGB vs. HSB colorMode
How can I represent colors in a mode other than RGB?

## Overview

In this learning activity students add color to the drawing they made in activity 1. They learn to apply the background, fill, and strokefunctions (used in scales of gray until now), to define colors and add transparency. Both the RGB (Red, green, blue) and HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color models are applied.

Students apply the programming concepts they learned in the previous unit (variables, randomness) to color manipulation, defining color ranges and palettes.

## Suggested Duration

45 minutes

## Objectives

### Students will be able to:

- explain and utilize the HSB color mode.
- understand the differences between RGB and HSB color modes.

## Student Outcomes

### Abstraction:

- Describe how I might use patterns to express an idea.
- Explain why using patterns is necessary when creating with a computer.

### Algorithms:

- Describe more than one set of instructions that might complete a task.
- Describe how instructions can have different outputs depending on inputs.
- Explain why I used specific instructions to complete a task.

### Programming:

- Experiment with the commands of a programming language.
- Explain why I chose specific commands to communicate my instructions.
- Discuss what can and cannot be done with a specific set of commands.

## Vocabulary

- Hue	The shade of a color
- Saturation	The intensity or vividness of a color (sometimes referred to as chroma)
- Brightness	The amount of white or black present in a color.
