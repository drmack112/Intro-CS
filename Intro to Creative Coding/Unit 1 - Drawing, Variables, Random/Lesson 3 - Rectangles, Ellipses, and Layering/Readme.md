# Rectangles, Ellipses, and Layering
How can we use shape functions to create images?

## Overview

In this learning activity students will create a visual composition using the p5 shape-drawing functions rect() and ellipse(). They will continue to build on their understanding of functions and their parameters to recreate the robot from lesson 1.

## Suggested Duration

45 minutes

## Objectives

Students will be able to:
- Consult the p5 reference
- Create rectangles using the rect() function
- Create ellipses using the ellipse() function
- Understand the concept of layering to create images using multiple shape functions

## Student Outcomes

### Abstraction:

- Give examples of specific patterns in something I can see, do or touch.
- Describe different things I tried in order to achieve a goal.
- Explain how I might help others identify patterns.

### Algorithms:

- Describe more than one set of instructions that might complete a task.
- Explain why I used specific instructions to complete a task.
- Compare and contrast my instructions with other instructions that complete the same task.

### Programming:

- Experiment with the commands of a programming language.
- Describe three ways a development environment helps me create a project.
- Explain why I chose specific commands to communicate my instructions.
- Discuss what can and cannot be done with a specific set of commands.

## Vocabulary

- **Functions**	Functions are lines of code that perform specific tasks.
- **Parameters** or **arguments**	Are the values inside of a parenthesis following the name of the function. These are used to change the outcome of a function
- **rect() function**	Draws a rectangle to the screen
- **ellipse() function**	Draws an ellipse to the screen
- **Height**	Vertical distance of a 2D shape
- **Rectangle**	A 2D figure with four straight sides and four right angles
- **Ellipse**	A regular oval shape
