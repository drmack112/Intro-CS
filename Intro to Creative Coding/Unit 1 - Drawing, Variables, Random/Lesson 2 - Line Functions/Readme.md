# Line Functions and Parameters
How do the parameters of function effect positioning on the p5 canvas?

## Overview

In this learning activity students will create a visual composition using the p5 shape-drawing functions (point, line). They will be introduced to functions parameters and then call them in p5.

## Suggested Duration

45 minutes

## Objectives

Students will be able to:
- Understand the p5 canvas coordinate system
- Consult the p5 reference for documentation
- Create a line and point
- Change the grayscale value of a canvas
- Use lines to create a rectangle or a house

## Student Outcomes

### Abstraction:

- Give examples of specific patterns in something I can see, do or touch.
- Describe different things I tried in order to achieve a goal.
- Explain how I might help others identify patterns.

### Algorithms:

- Describe more than one set of instructions that might complete a task.
- Explain why I used specific instructions to complete a task.
- Compare and contrast my instructions with other instructions that complete the same task.

### Programming:

- Experiment with the commands of a programming language
- Explain why I chose specific commands to communicate my instructions.
- Discuss what can and cannot be done with a specific set of commands.
