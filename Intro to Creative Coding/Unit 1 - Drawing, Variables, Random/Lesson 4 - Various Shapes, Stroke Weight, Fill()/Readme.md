# Various Shapes, Stroke Weight, Fill()
How can we use shape functions to create images?

## Overview

In this learning activity students will create a visual composition using various p5 shape-drawing functions. They will continue to build on their understanding of functions and their parameters to recreate the robot from lesson 1.

## Suggested Duration

45 minutes

## Objectives

Students will be able to:

- Consult the p5 reference
- Create triangles
- Create quadrilaterals
- Create arcs
- Create shapes defined by their vertices
- Use layering to create images

## Student Outcomes

### Abstraction:

- Give examples of specific patterns in something I can see, do or touch.
- Describe different things I tried in order to achieve a goal.
- Explain why I chose to include the specific components of my prototype over others.
- Explain how I might help others identify patterns.
- Explain why using patterns is necessary when creating with a computer.

### Algorithms:

- Describe more than one set of instructions that might complete a task.
- Explain why I used specific instructions to complete a task.
- Compare and contrast my instructions with other instructions that complete the same task.

### Programming:

- Experiment with the commands of a programming language.
- Describe three ways a development environment helps me create a project.
- Explain why I chose specific commands to communicate my instructions.
- Describe the changes I made after testing at least three parts of my program.
- Discuss what can and cannot be done with a specific set of commands.

## Vocabulary

- **Functions**	Functions are lines of code that perform specific tasks.
- **Parameters** or **arguments**	Are the values inside of a parenthesis following the name of the function. These are used to change the outcome of a function
- **Vertices**	Typically means a corner or a point where lines meet.
- **Quadrilateral**	A shape with four sides
- **Triangle**	A shape with three sides
