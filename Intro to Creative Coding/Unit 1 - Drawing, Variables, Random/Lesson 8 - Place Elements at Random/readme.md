# Place elements at random positions
How can we use the random function to generate different designs?

## Overview

In this learning activity, students will understand the concept of functions in a different way because unlike other functions we have been using (i.g. ellipse and rect) random will return a value. Rect() "returns" an image by generating it onto the canvas. The random() function will be one of many functions that will be used in future units in order to make sketches more complex and interactive.

## Suggested Duration

45 minutes

## Objectives

### Students will be able to:

- Use `random()` to generate different positioning, sizing and grayscale fill
- Assign `random()` to a function
- Use `random()` in the correct scope

## Student Outcomes

### Abstraction:

- Describe how I might use patterns to express an idea.
- Describe different things I tried in order to achieve a goal.
- Explain why using patterns is necessary when creating with a computer.

### Algorithms:

- Describe more than one set of instructions that might complete a task.
- Describe how instructions can have different outputs depending on inputs.
- Explain why I used specific instructions to complete a task.

### Programming:

- Experiment with the commands of a programming language.
- Explain why I chose specific commands to communicate my instructions.
- Discuss what can and cannot be done with a specific set of commands.

## Vocabulary

- **random()**	A function that returns a number in a given interval.
- **int()**	A mathematical function that converts the value into an integer.
