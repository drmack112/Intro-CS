# Unit 1 Drawing, Variables, Random
### How can code be used as a creative and expressive medium?

## Overview

In this unit students get acquainted with the p5 canvas coordinate system, drawing shapes and colors on it. Programming concepts covered include calling built-in p5 functions with different parameters, working with variables (both built-in and custom), and using controlled randomness.

## Suggested Duration

Duration based class meeting 5x a week with 45 min periods

## Big Ideas

- Code as a creative and expressive medium
- The concept of creating design systems: programmatically defining ranges for positions, dimensions, and colors, by using variables, randomness, and repetition. Drawing as collaboration between designer and system.

# Enduring Understandings

- Understand the basics of computation (execution flow, function calls, variables)
- Understand the basics of 2D computer graphics: drawing on a canvas, the coordinate system, calling drawing functions, setting colors in different color spaces
- Understand the application of variables, repetition and randomness to the creation of parametric drawings
