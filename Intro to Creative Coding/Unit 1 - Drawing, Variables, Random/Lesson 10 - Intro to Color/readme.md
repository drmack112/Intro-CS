# Intro to Color
How do computers mix colors?

## Overview

In this learning activity students add color to any of their previous designs. They learn to apply the background(), fill(), and stroke() functions (used in scales of gray until now), to define colors and add transparency. The RGB (red, green, blue) color model is applied.

Students apply the programming concepts they learned in the previous unit (variables, randomness) to color manipulation, defining color ranges and palettes.

## Suggested Duration

45 minutes

## Objectives

### Students will be able to:

- Describe the process by which computers mix colors (additive mixing)
- Use fill() to change the color of shapes in RGB color mode.

## Student Outcomes

### Abstraction:

- Describe how I might use patterns to express an idea.
- Explain why using patterns is necessary when creating with a computer.

### Algorithms:

- Describe more than one set of instructions that might complete a task.
- Describe how instructions can have different outputs depending on inputs.
- Explain why I used specific instructions to complete a task.

### Programming:

- Experiment with the commands of a programming language.
- Explain why I chose specific commands to communicate my instructions.
- Discuss what can and cannot be done with a specific set of commands.

## Vocabulary

- **fill()** function	Sets the color used to fill shapes.This color is either specified in terms of the RGB or HSB color depending on the current colorMode()
- **Subtractive Mixing**	The mixing you are used to seeing with paint - paint tints absorb different lights from around them to create the visual color you see.
- **Additive Mixing**	Mixing done with light - adding lights to create the different colors you see.
- **RGB**	Red, Green, Blue color mode, the default in p5.js
- **Opacity**	How see-through a shape is.
