# Introduction and Deconstruction
How can we break down a robot into basic shapes in p5.js?

## Overview

In this learning activity students will create a visual composition using the p5 shape-drawing functions (ellipse, rect, line, point, quad, triangle), and set their fill and stroke to a grayscale value.

They will understand the p5 canvas coordinate system, call functions and pass parameters to them, and consult the p5 reference for documentation about them.

## Suggested Duration

45 minutes

## Objectives

Students will be able to:

- Create an account on the editor
- Explain what p5.js is
- Describe things you can create on p5.js
- Understand the p5 canvas coordinate system

## Student Outcomes

### Abstraction:

- Give examples of specific patterns in something I can see, do or touch.
- Describe different things I tried in order to achieve a goal.
- Explain how I might help others identify patterns.

### Algorithms:

- Explain why I used specific instructions to complete a task.
- Compare and contrast my instructions with other instructions that complete the same task.
